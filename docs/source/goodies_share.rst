Share on Social Media
-----------------------

You can create share buttons for social media. This is based on the code I found at https://sharingbuttons.io/, 
which after a couple of hours of googling turned out to be the simplest way to share the content. 
Kudos to creator. It has some minor modifications, but it's mostly a wrapping of the code for stremlit.

It requires as arguments the message and the url.

.. autofunction:: __init__.share

.. raw:: html

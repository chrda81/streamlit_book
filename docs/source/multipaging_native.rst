Native multipaging
---------------------

* **Problem**: You don't want streamlit_book multipaging, but streamlit's native multipaging.
* **Solution**: Just pust your files on `pages/` and import streamlit_book on the files where you need them. You can mix streamlit_book and streamlit's native multipaging.

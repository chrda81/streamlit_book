Installation
====================

The repository for the code is hosted at `<https://github.com/sebastiandres/streamlit_book>`_.

**Install from pypi**

You can install the library from `pypi <https://pypi.org/project/streamlit_book/>`_. 
This is the safe way. Don't stray from this path.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install streamlit_book

On the `requirements.txt` file it should be simply the line:

.. code-block:: none

    streamlit_book

Or, optionally, for the specific version X.Y.Z:

.. code-block:: none

    streamlit_book==X.Y.Z

**Install from repository**

You can install the library directly from the latest available version on github. 
This is good for testing the library, but might encounter some bugs, in which case you should let us know!

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/sebastiandres/streamlit_book.git

On the `requirements.txt` file it should be simply the line:

.. code-block:: none

    git+https://github.com/sebastiandres/streamlit_book.git
